# Installation

## Picking the host

The `.bashrc` file is a soft link to one of the host-specific configurations. 

The current link points at my current machine, but that can be changed easily.

```bash
ln -s .bashrc.d/bashrc-{hostname} .bashrc
```

## Use GNU stow...
...to create the symlinks to `$HOME`
