Gnome/Unity custom key bindings
===============================

# Usage

Use `./pull` to get the updated settings and `git diff` to check for changes.

Use `./push` to initialize a new system, if you really have to.

:warning: DO NOT EDIT `media-keys.dconf` file by hand: Unity will crash on minimal changes. Always use the graphical editor.
